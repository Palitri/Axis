To be able to run and debug Axis Web on your local machine, you might need to have a web server running.

Set the web server to host the whole Axis folder (so that both the "Resoruces" folder and the "Web" folder are accessible)

To do that in Windows, first make sure you have the Internet Information Services features switched on (directions for Win7)
1. Go to Control Panel -> Programs and Featrues
2. Select "Turn Windows features on of off"
3. From "Internet Information Services", make sure "World Wide Web Services" is checked

To set up a web server (directions for Win7)
1. Go to Control Panel -> Administrative Tools
2. Select Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager
3. In the "Connections" panel, right click the root item at the top and select "Add web site"
4. Set "Physical Path" to the Axis folder, choose a site name, for example "Axis" and click ok
5. In your browser of choice, you should be able to access "http://localhost/Web/HostPage.html"
