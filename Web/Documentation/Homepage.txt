Application programming interface documentation
</p>
<p>
These documents describe the API for the JavaScript implementation of the Axis 3D engine for web pages.
<br>
This programming interface follows the C++ desktop implentation as closely as possible, though there are some language and platform specifics in each implementation.
</p>
<p>
The web implementation of the engine is provided as a project of multiple files in the <a href="http://palitri.com/vault/axis/engine/sdk/current/AxisEngineSDK.zip">Axis SDK</a>
<br/>
This is useful when developing your project.
</p>
<p>
It is also available in the form of a single file
<br/>
This is useful when deploying the final version of your project.

This documentation references the source code files from the project included in the SDK.
The project files, AxisEngine-full.js and AxisEngine-min.js of the same version are practically the same thing and provide identical API and functionality.
