Axis Editor Readme



To create a deployment of the editor:
1. Make sure the paths in "Set Variables.cmd" are all correct
2. Build release versions of both the engine and the editor
3. Execute "Deploy.cmd"

This will create an "Axis\Editor\bin" directory, where the editor will be deployed along with the required Qt and Axis libraries.



To flush the makefiles:
1. Make sure the paths in "Flush Makefiles.cmd" are all correct
2. Execute "Flush Makefiles.cmd"

This will delete the makefiles in the debug and relese folders.
This may sometimes be needed, if the compiler refuses to use some freshly updated source code.
