Note that, where possible, the required DLL files are included in the package itself, so you wouldn't have to bother installing various stuff before being able to run it.
The downside is that if you're using a different version of VS you might need other versions of the dlls (and especially the c++ redistributables)

For the DirectX module, you will need the DirectX SDK installed in order to be able to compile and run the module.

For modules, which need SDKs and tools you don't currently have available, you can just unload the respective modules' project from the solution.
